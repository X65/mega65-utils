# Various C65 / M65 testing tools/utilities

The actual binary version (which can be outdated!) can be found in the
bin/ directory, in the form of invididual PRG files, or a D81 disk image.

Currently:

## DMAtest

It's intended to test on *REAL* C65s to see some corner cases and not too
well known behaviours of F018 (rev A or B) DMA. Most likely, it can help
to create better C65 implementation in VHDL and/or C65 emulator software.
