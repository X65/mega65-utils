Various Z80/8080 based stuffs are here.
You'll need sjasm 0.42 installed to be compile them.
Syntax is Z80, so you must be careful not to use Z80 specific opcode,
since we're talking about 8080 only :)

Because it's maybe odd for people to have Z80 assembler installed when
they intended 65xx code, binaries are also stored here, so you need to
say 'make' here only, if you change the Z80/8080 assembly sources.
