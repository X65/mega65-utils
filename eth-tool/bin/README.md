# Ethernet test-program for Mega65

Please read this: https://github.com/lgblgblgb/mega65-utils/blob/master/eth-tool/README.md

And the source: https://github.com/lgblgblgb/mega65-utils/blob/master/eth-tool

You can find only (**maybe not the latest - you SHOULD compile the source version**) binary version here ...

tool.d81.gz is the gzip'ed D81 disk image

tool.prg.gz is the gzip'ed PRG file

Program should be loaded in C64 mode (thus, `GO64` first)
