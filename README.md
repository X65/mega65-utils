Various Mega-65 related utilities, and software, both of native (running on
the M65 directly) and cross-platform stuffs. Currently this is more like some
experiments rather than serious things though.

For compilation, you may need CA65 assembler (from the CC65 suite) with
up-to-date version (with 65CE02/4510 stuffs) and Linux/UNIX-like standard
evelopment environment with GNU Make, general UNIX utilities, Python, etc ...

For quick testing of native tools, Xemu is highly recommended, installed
in the default search path as xemu-mega65 (for the Mega65 emulator of Xemu).
