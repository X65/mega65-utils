Various Mega-65 related utilities, and software, both of native (running on
the M65 directly) and cross-platform stuffs. Currently this is more like some
experiments rather than serious things though.

For compilation, you may need CA65 assembler (from the CC65 suite) with
up-to-date version (with 65CE02/4502 stuffs) and Linux/UNIX-like standard
evelopment environment with GNU Make, general UNIX utilities, Python, etc ...
