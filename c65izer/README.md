# C65-izer

A lame attempt to try to produce a little binary which can be glued at
the beginning of C64 programs (the ones use the "BASIC stub loader"), so
then it can be loaded from C65 mode directly, and no need to issue "GO 64"
first. For more details, see c65izer.asm comments

c65izer as a binary is also included.

equinoxe-c64 is a PSID file converted with PSID64, which is used to test
this utility with, simply.

WARNING: extremely ugly ...
